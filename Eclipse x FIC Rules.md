* **Qualification:** Organizer's nicknames or the tournament name.

* Four participants will bypass this stage through direct invitations, as outlined in [Section 3](#3-direct-invitations).

**2.2 Group Stage**

* 32 participants (28 qualified + 4 directly invited) will be divided into two score-based groups (A & B) of 16 participants each. 
* The top 4 participants from each group will advance to the Playoff Stage.
* Participants ranked 5th to 12th in each group will advance to the Play-In Stage.
* The remaining participants will be eliminated.

**2.3 Play-In Stage**

* 16 participants (ranked 5th-12th in their respective groups) will compete in a single score-based group.
* The top 8 participants will advance to the Playoff Stage.
* The remaining participants will be eliminated.

**2.4 Playoff Stage**

* The Playoff Stage will follow a single-elimination bracket format.

### 3. Direct Invitations

**3.1 Awarded to**

* Eclipse Open Champion

### 6. Judging Criteria and Scoring

**6.1** Entries will be evaluated and scored based on the following criteria:

| Criterion        | Weighting |
|:-----------------|----------:|
| Animation        | 1.50      |
| Color Correction | 1.50      |
| Effects          | 1.25      |
| Creativity       | 1.75      |
| Atmosphere       | 0.75      |
| Flow             | 1.15      |
| Background       | 1.20      |

**6.2 Evaluation Process**

* Judges will score each entry on a 10-point scale for each criterion.
* Each criterion score will be multiplied by its corresponding weighting factor.
* The weighted scores will be summed to generate a raw score.
* The raw score will be multiplied by a Normalization Coefficient (calculated by dividing 10 by the sum of the weighting factors) to scale the final score to a 100-point system.
* The final score for an entry will be the arithmetic mean of the normalized scores from all judges.

**Example:** A judge scores an entry as follows: Animation 8, Color Correction 7, Effects 9, Creativity 8, Atmosphere 9, Flow 7, Background 8. Multiplying each score by its weight (1.50, 1.50, 1.25, 1.75, 0.75, 1.15, 1.20 respectively) and summing gives a raw score of 72.15. This is then multiplied by the normalization coefficient of 1.0989 (10 divided by the sum of weights, 9.10) to yield a final score of 79.29 out of 100.


**6.3 Tiebreaker Rules.** In case of a tie in points between two participants, the following tiebreakers will be applied in order:

* Judges' vote.
* Rematch.
* Higher average score (initial match + rematch).
* Higher average tournament score (including qualification).
* Higher previous round score.


### 7. Verification & Penalties

**7.1 Project Files.** The Organizer may request project files at any time to verify the originality of submissions.

**7.2 Reasonable Suspicion.** Requests for project files may arise due to:

* Strong resemblance to existing work.
* Suspected use of third-party assets.
* Reports from other participants regarding potential rule violations.

**7.3 Non-Compliance.** Failure to provide the requested files within 48 hours in the specified format will be deemed a rule violation, resulting in penalties as outlined in Rule 7.4.

**7.4 Penalties.** Penalties will be determined at the organizer's discretion based on the nature and severity of the violation. Possible penalties include:

* Score reduction or ranking adjustment.
* Prize forfeiture.
* Disqualification.
* Temporary or permanent ban from ECLIPSE x FIC tournaments.


### 8. Prizes and Payouts

**8.1 Payout Methods.** Prize payouts will primarily be disbursed via PayPal. If PayPal disbursement is not feasible, the following alternative methods will be used in descending order of preference: bank transfer, Counter-Strike 2 skins, USDT TRC20, and BTC.

**8.2 Payout Timing.** While every effort will be made to disburse prize payouts within 7 days of the tournament's conclusion, the maximum allowable payout period will not exceed 90 days from the tournament's official end date.

**8.3 Prize Distribution**
